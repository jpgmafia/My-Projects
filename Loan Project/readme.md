# ProsperLoan
## by Omar Adel


## Dataset

> I selected ProsperLoan from the provided dataset options from Udacity. This data set contains several loans with many variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
I selected 20 Variables from the 81 and dropped null values from the new dataset.

## Summary of Findings

> 1. I've found that Monthly Payment increased by the increase in loan amount. On the contrary, I made a diagonal to mark the other trend which is Small Loan Amounts can have large monthly payments but that trends lies between 0 - 15000 Loan Original Amounts.
2. Also, the amount of Loan doesn't necessarily increase by the increase in investors funding the loan. 
3. Almost every borrower gets 3 year loan no matter how high his income range is.
4. There's is a weak positive relationship between Stated Monthly Income and either Loan Original Amount or Borrower Interest Rate.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> 1. Does Stated Monthly Income affect the Monthly Loan Payment or Loan Original Amount?
2. Do monthly payments increase by the increase in loan amounts?
