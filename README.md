# My-Projects
This is a repository for the projects I've worked on for Udacity's Data Analysis Nanodegree.
The first folder includes 'Investigating TMDb Dataset' 
In TMDb project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicated my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.
The Second folder includes 'Exploring US BikeShare Data'
In BikeShare project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
