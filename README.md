# My-Projects
> This is a repository for the projects I've worked on for Udacity's Data Analysis Nanodegree.
-   The first folder includes 'Exploring US BikeShare Data'.




    In BikeShare project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City,     and Washington. 
    I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input     to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
    
    
    
    
-   The second folder includes 'Investigating TMDb dataset'.




    In TMDb project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicated my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my       analysis easier.




-   The third one includes *A/B Test Results*.




    In A/B Test Results project, I was working  to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web      page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal was    to work through this project to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment          longer to make their decision.
    
    
    
    
-The forth folder includes 'Prosper Loan'
In Prosper Loan project, This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in my selected dataset. The primary method of conveying my findings will be through transforming my exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
After completing the project, I was able to:
1. Supplement statistics with visualizations to build understanding of data.
2. Choose appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset, allowing you to understand distributions of variables and relationships between features.
3. Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.
